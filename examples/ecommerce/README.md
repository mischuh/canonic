# Canonic ecommerce demo

A small but end-to-end Canonic project: a Postgres connection, a four-source star schema
(two facts, three dimensions), three canonical metrics, one enforced guardrail, and a
companion dbt manifest demonstrating the E3 definition connector.
Covers the complete **Phase 1 loop**: ingest bootstraps context from a real stack, the
MCP server gives agents both executable definitions and business meaning, and `canonic eval`
tracks accuracy. See [E3 connectors](#e3-connectors--definitions--evidence-beyond-the-primary-source)
for the dbt / Notion / Metabase / Looker sources that feed meaning beyond raw introspection.

## Phase 1 loop

```
canonic ingest --bootstrap          # 1. bootstrap: introspect Postgres → write semantics/*.yaml
canonic mcp start                   # 2. serve: agents call query() + search_knowledge() together
canonic eval baseline \             # 3. track: measure grain-inference accuracy on the live schema
  --candidates candidates.yaml \
  --dataset eval/grain_cases.jsonl
```

Each step proves one Phase 1 exit criterion:

| Step | Criterion |
| --- | --- |
| `canonic ingest --bootstrap` | Bootstraps context from a real stack |
| `query()` + `search_knowledge()` | Agents get both executable definitions and business meaning |
| `canonic eval baseline` | Accuracy is tracked |

```

## Prerequisites

- Python ≥ 3.13, Canonic installed (`pip install -e ../..` from this directory)
- A Postgres database you can write to (local Docker, Neon free tier, etc.)

## Setup

**1. Create the tables and seed data:**

```sh
export CANONIC_PG_PASSWORD=postgres   # password for the postgres user
psql "postgres://postgres:${CANONIC_PG_PASSWORD}@localhost:5432/postgres" < setup.sql
```

The script is **idempotent** — re-running it drops and recreates all tables in the correct
order, so schema changes (e.g. a new column) are always applied cleanly. The `analytics`
schema is declared once in `canonic.yaml` (`schema: analytics`) and applied as `search_path`
on every session — no need to embed it in the connection string.

**2. Verify the project is recognised:**

```sh
cd examples/ecommerce   # ← must run canonic commands from here
canonic status
# Canonic project: ecommerce-demo (version 1)
# Root: /path/to/examples/ecommerce
# Connection: warehouse_pg (postgres)
```

## Start the MCP server

**Stdio — for Claude Code / Cursor (the MCP client owns the process):**

```sh
canonic mcp start
```

Add this to your Claude Code MCP config (`~/.claude.json` or the project `.claude.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canonic": {
      "command": "canonic",
      "args": ["mcp", "start"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/examples/ecommerce"
    }
  }
}
```

```
"mcpServers": {
    "canonic": {
      "command": "/Users/mirko/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "canonic@/Users/mirko/dev/canonic", 
        "canonic",
        "mcp",
        "start"
      ],
      "cwd": "/Users/mirko/dev/canonic/examples/rental"
    }
  },
```

**HTTP daemon — background process, multiple clients can connect:**

```sh
canonic mcp start --http --port 7474
canonic mcp status   # shows: running | PID | version | transport
canonic mcp stop     # SIGTERM + removes .canonic/mcp.json
```

If the daemon starts but immediately dies (e.g. port already in use, import error), check
`.canonic/mcp.log` — stdout and stderr from the daemon process are written there:

```sh
tail -f .canonic/mcp.log
```

Connect your MCP client to the running daemon — no `command`/`args`, just a URL:

**Claude Code** (`~/.claude.json` or project `.claude.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canonic": {
      "transport": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:7474/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The server uses FastMCP's **Streamable HTTP** transport (MCP spec 2025-03-26) at `/mcp`.
If your client only supports SSE, use `/sse` instead.

Only `--http` mode writes `.canonic/mcp.json`. In stdio mode the MCP client owns the
process — no state file is created and `.canonic/` stays absent; that is expected.

## Example tool calls

Once the MCP server is running, an agent can call these tools:

**List all canonical metrics:**
```json
list_metrics()
→ [
    {"metric": "revenue",     "source": "orders",      "measure": "total_revenue", "aliases": ["net revenue", "rev"]},
    {"metric": "order_count", "source": "orders",      "measure": "order_count",   "aliases": ["orders", "number of orders"]},
    {"metric": "units_sold",  "source": "order_items", "measure": "units_sold",    "aliases": ["units", "quantity sold"]}
  ]
```

**Revenue by day (guardrail fires automatically):**
```json
query({"metrics": ["revenue"], "dimensions": ["order_date"]})
→ {
    "result": {
      "columns": [{"name": "order_date", "type": "timestamp"}, {"name": "total_revenue", "type": "decimal"}],
      "rows": [["2025-01-10T00:00:00", 500.0], ["2025-01-12T00:00:00", 350.0], ...]
    },
    "compiled": {"sql": "SELECT … WHERE \"orders\".\"status\" <> 'refunded' …", "dialect": "postgres"},
    "metadata": {
      "resolved": {"metrics": {"revenue": "orders.total_revenue"}},
      "guardrails_fired": [{"id": "revenue-excludes-refunds", "kind": "mandatory_filter"}],
      "freshness": [{"source": "orders", "last_validated_at": null, "stale": false}]
    }
  }
```

**Revenue by country (uses the many_to_one join to customers):**
```json
query({"metrics": ["revenue", "order_count"], "dimensions": ["country"]})
```

**Revenue by sales channel (many_to_one join orders → channels):**
```json
query({"metrics": ["revenue"], "dimensions": ["channel"]})
```

**Units sold by product category (order_items → products):**
```json
query({"metrics": ["units_sold"], "dimensions": ["category"]})
→ {"result": {"columns": [{"name": "category", …}, {"name": "units_sold", …}],
              "rows": [["Accessories", …], ["Displays", …], ["Furniture", …]]}, …}
// units_sold across non-refunded orders totals 33
```

**Compile only — no execution:**
```json
compile_query({"metrics": ["revenue"], "dimensions": ["order_date"]})
→ {"sql": "SELECT …", "dialect": "postgres", "resolved": {…}, "guardrails_fired": […]}
```

**Ambiguous name → structured error, no crash:**
```json
resolve_metric("rev")
→ {"metric": "revenue", "source": "orders", "measure": "total_revenue"}
```

**Business meaning alongside executable SQL — search_knowledge:**
```json
search_knowledge("revenue reporting policy")
→ {
    "hits": [
      {
        "page": "revenue-reporting-policy",
        "summary": "Month-end cutoff rules for revenue reporting.",
        "usage_mode": "policy",
        "matched_on": ["lexical"],
        "sl_refs": ["warehouse_pg.orders.total_revenue"]
      }
    ],
    "caveats": [
      {
        "page": "revenue-excludes-refunds-caveat",
        "summary": "Revenue figures exclude orders with status = 'refunded'.",
        "triggered_by": ["warehouse_pg.orders.total_revenue"]
      }
    ]
  }
```

The `search_knowledge()` tool surfaces knowledge pages by topic. Caveats are
**auto-surfaced** whenever a hit's bound semantic entity (`sl_refs`) matches a caveat
page — so the refund caveat rides along whenever any revenue topic is returned, even
if the query was about reporting policy, not refunds.

A typical agent pattern is `query()` for executable SQL + `search_knowledge()` for
business context — both calls together, one decision:

```json
// Step 1: get rows
query({"metrics": ["revenue"], "dimensions": ["order_date"]})

// Step 2: understand the business rules
search_knowledge("revenue definition")
→ { "hits": [{"page": "revenue-definition", "usage_mode": "definition", …}],
    "caveats": [{"page": "revenue-excludes-refunds-caveat", …}] }
```

## Ingestion — keep semantics current as the schema evolves

`canonic ingest` refreshes the semantic files from the live Postgres schema.  The demo project
ships with **hand-authored** (`provenance: human_curated`) files; an ingest run reconciles the
live schema against them and surfaces any drift as a reviewable diff — without overwriting the
curated definitions silently.

**Dry run — see what would change, write nothing:**

```sh
canonic ingest --dry-run
# Decisions: add: 0, no_op: 2, …
# (no_op because orders.yaml and customers.yaml already match the live schema)
```

**Bootstrap a connection from scratch** (for a fresh project without hand-authored files):

```sh
canonic ingest --bootstrap
# Introspects warehouse_pg → writes semantics/warehouse_pg/*.yaml deterministically
```

**Full ingest — propose diffs for review:**

```sh
canonic ingest
# Writes raw-sources/warehouse_pg/evidence.jsonl (committed, reproducible)
# Writes .canonic/ingest-events.jsonl             (local audit log, git-ignored)
# Edits no committed semantics in place
```

**JSON output — machine-readable reconciliation report:**

```sh
canonic --json ingest --dry-run
# {"diffs": […], "notes": [], "report": {"entries": […], "summary": {"add": 0, "no_op": 2, …}}}
```

**Headless / CI — deterministic pipeline + auto-PR:**

```sh
# Same result on every run with the same schema (identical proposals, identical JSON):
canonic ingest --headless --no-pr

# Full CI recipe: open a PR if diffs exist, fail on contradictions:
canonic --json ingest --headless --strict
# exit 0  → clean run (PR opened if diffs, or no-op)
# exit 9  → VALIDATION_FAILED — proposed output invalid, no PR
# exit 13 → CONNECTION_ERROR  — Postgres unreachable
# exit 14 → CONTRADICTION     — --strict flagged a drift that conflicts with a curated fact
```

Example GitHub Actions job (add to `.github/workflows/`):

```yaml
- name: Canonic ingest
  run: canonic --json ingest --headless --strict
  working-directory: examples/ecommerce
  env:
    CI: "true"
    CANONIC_PG_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.CANONIC_PG_PASSWORD }}
```

**Contradiction example** — what happens when schema drift conflicts with a curated fact:

The `orders.yaml` and `customers.yaml` files carry `provenance: human_curated`.  If the live
Postgres schema diverges from those definitions (e.g. a column type changes), ingest flags a
`contradiction` entry in the report but **keeps the curated file untouched**.  With `--strict`
the run exits 14; without it, the contradiction note rides into the PR body for a human to
resolve.

## E3 connectors — definitions & evidence beyond the primary source

Postgres introspection (E2) tells Canonic what tables *exist*; the **E3 connectors** tell it
what those tables *mean*. They fall into two capability classes, and the core dispatches on
the capability a connector advertises — never on the vendor name (SPEC-E3 §2):

| Class | Capability | Connectors | Normalized output | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | `extract_definitions` | dbt | `RelationSchema` + `DefinitionEvidence` | `modeling` |
| **Evidence** | `extract_evidence` | Notion | `DocEvidence` | `hand_authored` |
| **Evidence** | `extract_evidence` | Metabase, Looker | `UsageEvidence` | `query_history` |

Two invariants hold for every E3 connector:

- **No execution.** None of them advertise `run_read_only_sql` — a definition or BI source is
  read for *meaning*, never queried for *data* (SPEC-E3 §2, S8). The no-execution guard is
  structural: there is no code path from an E3 connector to a database.
- **Normalized seam.** Each connector emits Canonic's normalized evidence schema, re-validated
  before it crosses into the pipeline; unknown or invalid evidence is logged and dropped, never
  passed through half-formed (SPEC-E3 §7, S7). No vendor shape ever reaches the reconciler.

### dbt — a definition connector you can run offline

This demo ships a compiled dbt manifest at [`dbt/manifest.json`](dbt/manifest.json) modeling the
same star schema (`fct_orders`, `fct_order_items`, three dimensions) with measures, entities,
and joins. It is wired into [`canonic.yaml`](canonic.yaml) as a second connection — **no database,
no credentials**:

```yaml
connections:
  - id: warehouse_dbt
    type: dbt
    params:
      manifest_path: dbt/manifest.json   # relative to canonic.yaml
    # no credentials_ref — a manifest is a local file, not a guarded endpoint
```

`canonic ingest` reconciles the manifest into reviewable semantic proposals exactly like the
Postgres path — but entirely from the file, so it runs with **no Postgres and no LLM**:

```sh
canonic ingest --connection warehouse_dbt --dry-run
# # Ingest reconciliation summary
# ## Decisions
# - add: 5            ← one proposal per dbt model
# - contradiction: 0
#
# ### semantics/warehouse_dbt/fct_orders.yaml (add)
# - provenance: inferred, confidence: 1.0
# +joins:
# +- to: dim_customers
# +  on: fct_orders.customer_id = dim_customers.customer_id
# +  relationship: many_to_one          ← reconstructed from the manifest's FK constraints
```

What the connector pulls out of the manifest, all at acquisition tier `modeling`:

- **`RelationSchema`** per model — columns + normalized types, primary key, and foreign keys
  lifted into Canonic's join shape (`many_to_one`).
- **`DefinitionEvidence`** for each `model`, `entity`, `join`, `measure`, and `dimension` —
  e.g. `total_revenue` (`agg: sum` → `additive`), the `order_id` grain, the
  `orders → customers` join.

**Modeling tier outranks raw introspection.** When the same relation is described by both the
live Postgres schema (tier `live`) and the dbt manifest (tier `modeling`), reconciliation lets
the modeling tier win on semantics — a hand-modeled grain or additivity beats whatever could be
guessed from raw columns. A genuine disagreement (e.g. conflicting column types) is surfaced as
a **contradiction**, never silently merged (SPEC-E3 §6).

**Version pinning fails loudly.** The connector enforces a manifest schema floor (`v10+`, dbt
Core 1.6+). An older manifest is rejected with `UnsupportedSourceVersionError` and ingests
**nothing** — no partial import from an incompatible artifact (SPEC-E3 §6, S5).

### Evidence connectors — Notion, Metabase, Looker (need live services)

These read prose and BI usage rather than schema. Unlike dbt they require a reachable endpoint
and a credential. To make the evidence flow concrete without a live Notion workspace, this demo
ships five sample Notion page sources in [`docs/notion-pages/`](docs/notion-pages/) — one per
knowledge page type, in the format the Notion connector expects. You can read them to understand
what to write in your own Notion workspace before pointing Canonic at it.

Add any evidence connector as another connection:

```yaml
connections:
  # Prose → DocEvidence → E6 knowledge pages (usage_hint maps 1:1 to usage_mode)
  - id: handbook_notion
    type: notion
    params:
      api_version: "2022-06-28"        # optional; pins the Notion API version
    credentials_ref: env:NOTION_TOKEN

  # BI questions → UsageEvidence (candidates only — never auto-promoted to canonic, FR-13)
  - id: bi_metabase
    type: metabase
    params:
      base_url: https://metabase.internal
    credentials_ref: env:METABASE_API_KEY

  - id: bi_looker
    type: looker
    params:
      base_url: https://looker.internal
    credentials_ref: env:LOOKER_API_TOKEN
```

- **Notion → `DocEvidence`.** A page's `usage_hint` (`reference` / `caveat` / `policy` /
  `definition`) maps directly to an E6 knowledge page's `usage_mode`, so a caveat written in
  Notion becomes a caveat that auto-surfaces alongside the metric it warns about (see
  [Knowledge pages](#knowledge-pages-e6) below). Topic references are resolved as *candidates*
  on write — unresolved ones are flagged for review, never written as broken links.

  The connector reads two Notion **page properties** you set in the Notion sidebar — no body
  markup required:

  | Notion property | Type | Maps to |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `Canonic Type` | select | `DocEvidence.usage_hint` → E6 `usage_mode` |
  | `Canonic Topics` | multi-select | `DocEvidence.topic_refs` (candidates for E6 to resolve) |

  The sample files in [`docs/notion-pages/`](docs/notion-pages/) show this format — the YAML
  frontmatter in those files represents the Notion sidebar properties; the Markdown body becomes
  `DocEvidence.body`. Each file also includes a short **"How this becomes a Canonic knowledge page"**
  section explaining the ingestion chain for that specific page type.
- **Metabase / Looker → `UsageEvidence`.** A dashboard's metric definition is observed BI
  usage, a reconciliation *signal* — a candidate, never canonic. Its `role` is bounded to
  `alternative` (feeds deprecated-alternatives) or `trusted_example` (feeds assertion
  candidates); there is no `canonical` role, so auto-promotion of a BI question to a canonical
  binding is structurally unrepresentable (PRD FR-13, SPEC-E3 §3.3).

Once configured, a full `canonic ingest` (no `--connection`) gathers evidence from **every**
connection in one pass — Postgres introspection, dbt definitions, and doc/usage evidence —
dispatching on each connector's declared capabilities and merging the normalized streams.

## Accuracy tracking — `canonic eval baseline`

`canonic eval` measures how accurately a local model infers grain from schema alone (SPEC-E10
§7). The harness runs the production `draft` path over the labeled cases in
`eval/grain_cases.jsonl` and writes a markdown report.

**Run the baseline against your local model:**

```sh
# Point candidates.yaml at your running model server, then:
canonic eval baseline \
  --candidates candidates.yaml \
  --dataset eval/grain_cases.jsonl \
  --out docs/baseline-models.md
# gemma-4-e2b-it-4bit: accuracy 80%, structured-output 100%, p50 310 ms ✓ recommended
```

The harness scores each case as correct/incorrect (exact grain match), records structured-output
adherence (did the model honor the JSON schema), and reports p50 latency + median tokens. A
model must clear 90% structured-output adherence to be recommendable — accuracy alone is not
enough if the output is frequently unparseable.

**The five ecommerce cases** in `eval/grain_cases.jsonl` exercise the shape of the live schema:
single surrogate key (`dim_customers`, `dim_channels`, `fct_orders`), descriptive surrogate key
(`dim_products`), and a line-item fact (`fct_order_items`) where `order_item_id` is the grain
rather than the composite `(order_id, product_id)`.

No LLM config is needed to run the rest of the project — `canonic eval baseline` is the only
command that makes live model calls.

## CLI usage

The same project works directly from the terminal — no MCP client needed.

**Create a query file:**

```sh
cat > q.json <<'EOF'
{"metrics": ["revenue"], "dimensions": ["order_date"]}
EOF
```

**Human output (Rich table):**

```sh
canonic query -f q.json
# ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
# ┃ order_date          ┃ total_revenue ┃
# ┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
# │ 2025-01-10T00:00:00 │ 500.00        │
# │ …                   │ …             │
```

**Machine output (`--json`) — byte-identical to the MCP `query` tool:**

```sh
canonic --json query -f q.json
```

```json
{
  "result":   { "columns": […], "rows": […], "truncated": false },
  "compiled": { "sql": "SELECT … WHERE \"orders\".\"status\" <> 'refunded' …", "dialect": "postgres" },
  "metadata": {
    "resolved":         {"metrics": {"revenue": "orders.total_revenue"}},
    "guardrails_fired": [{"id": "revenue-excludes-refunds", "kind": "mandatory_filter"}],
    "freshness":        [{"source": "orders", "last_validated_at": "…", "stale": false}]
  }
}
```

**Revenue by country (join to customers fires automatically):**

```sh
cat > q.json <<'EOF'
{"metrics": ["revenue", "order_count"], "dimensions": ["country"]}
EOF
canonic --json query -f q.json
```

**Raw read-only SQL:**

```sh
canonic sql "SELECT status, sum(amount) FROM analytics.fct_orders GROUP BY status"
canonic --json sql "SELECT count(*) FROM analytics.fct_orders"

# Non-SELECT is rejected before touching the database:
canonic sql "DROP TABLE analytics.fct_orders"
# error: read_only_violation: …
# echo $? → 11
```

**Structured errors on unknown or ambiguous metrics:**

```sh
# exit 2 — metric name matches no active binding
cat > q.json <<'EOF'
{"metrics": ["mrr"]}
EOF
canonic --json query -f q.json   # stderr: {"code": "unresolved", "message": "…"}
echo $?                        # 2
```

**CLI vs. MCP — same result:** `canonic --json query` and the MCP `query` tool both call
the same `CanonicService` and serialize via the same Pydantic model. The walking-skeleton
E2E test (`tests/e2e/test_walking_skeleton.py::test_parity`) asserts byte-identical
payloads against live Postgres on every CI run.

## Event log & observability (`canonic report`)

Every query the MCP server or CLI serves appends a `served_answer` event to
`.canonic/events.jsonl` — a local, append-only NDJSON file that is git-ignored. Every
`canonic ingest` run appends `reconcile_decision` events to the same file. Both kinds share
one unified log; nothing leaves the machine.

**Human report — counts, latency, bytes scanned, error distribution:**

```sh
canonic report
# canonic report  (telemetry: off)
#
# answers:        42  (2026-06-01T08:00:00Z → 2026-06-19T16:45:12Z)

**Restrict to the last N events:**

```sh
canonic report --last 100
```

**Machine-readable — for dashboards or CI:**

```sh
canonic --json report --last 50
# {"count": 42, "error_distribution": {"ok": 40, "unresolved": 2},
#  "latency": {"p50_ms": 310, "p95_ms": 1240, …},
#  "bytes_scanned": {"total": 1234567, …},
#  "telemetry_enabled": false, …}
```

**What is logged — and what is not:**

| Logged | Not logged |
| --- | --- |
| `query_hash` (SHA-256 of request) | SQL text |
| `compiled_sql_hash` (SHA-256 of compiled SQL) | Result rows |
| `latency_ms`, `bytes_scanned` | Guardrail filter literals |
| `guardrails_fired` (IDs only) | LLM prompts or completions |
| `error` (code string or null) | Any user-supplied query text |

The schema is frozen at contract version `1.1` (SPEC-E16 §6); reserved fields
(`trust_score`, `cache_hit`, `over_limit_blocked`) are present and null until Phase 2.

## Privacy & air-gapped mode

`telemetry.enabled: false` is the default — the local event log is pure local I/O and
nothing is sent off-machine. To enforce this at the config level and prevent it from ever
being enabled accidentally, set `runtime.air_gapped: true`:

```yaml
# canonic.yaml
runtime:
  air_gapped: true   # blocks telemetry.enabled: true at load time (exit 18)
```

With `air_gapped: true`, Canonic also validates at load time that:

- The LLM `base_url` resolves only to a loopback or explicitly allowlisted address.
- Secret refs (`credentials_ref`, `api_key_ref`) use only local schemes — `env:`, `file:`,
  or `keyring:`. Remote secret services (e.g. `vault:`) are rejected.

The daemon never starts mis-configured — any violation is a hard exit 18 before the first
query is served. `canonic status` is the fastest way to confirm a config passes:

```sh
canonic status
# Canonic project: ecommerce-demo (version 1)   ← load succeeded, all constraints satisfied
```

To add an on-prem inference host outside loopback:

```yaml
runtime:
  air_gapped: true
  allow_cidrs:
    - 10.0.0.0/8   # private inference server at 10.x.x.x
```

## What the guardrail does

The `revenue-excludes-refunds` guardrail is a `mandatory_filter`. Every time a query
touches `orders.total_revenue` the compiler automatically AND-s `status != 'refunded'`
into the WHERE clause and records it in `guardrails_fired`. The seed data has two
refunded orders (IDs 2 and 8, total 260.00) — they never appear in revenue results.

Expected revenue after guardrail: **3790.50** (7 completed + 1 pending order).

## Knowledge pages (E6)

The `knowledge/global/` directory adds searchable context on top of the semantic layer —
the "why" that makes an agent's answers trustworthy, not just technically correct.

### Page format

Each page is Markdown with YAML frontmatter. `scope` and `id` are derived from the path
(`knowledge/global/revenue-definition.md` → global scope, id `revenue-definition`);
everything else is in frontmatter:

```yaml
# knowledge/global/revenue-definition.md
---
summary: "What total_revenue means and how it is calculated."
tags: [revenue, definitions, metrics]
sl_refs:
  - warehouse_pg.orders.total_revenue   # ties this page to the live semantic entity
usage_mode: definition                   # reference | caveat | policy | definition
meta:
  provenance: human_curated
  last_validated_at: "2026-06-17T00:00:00Z"
  bound_fingerprints:
    "warehouse_pg.orders.total_revenue": "sha256:…"  # drift detection anchor
---

The live SQL — rendered at read time, never a copy:
> `{{ sl:warehouse_pg.orders.total_revenue.expr }}`
```

`{{ sl:<entity>.expr }}` directives are resolved against the live semantic layer at read
time by `DefinitionRenderer`, so the rendered definition can never fall out of sync with
the semantic source.

### `usage_mode` values in this example

| Page | `usage_mode` | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `revenue-definition` | `definition` | Canonical prose definition; surfaced by search |
| `units-sold-definition` | `definition` | Canonical prose definition for `units_sold`; surfaced by search |
| `revenue-excludes-refunds-caveat` | `caveat` | **Auto-surfaced** when any result references `total_revenue` |
| `order-items-fanout-caveat` | `caveat` | **Auto-surfaced** when any result references `units_sold` or `line_revenue` |
| `revenue-reporting-policy` | `policy` | Business rule page; ranked like `reference` but tagged as policy |

### Search and caveat surfacing (Python API)

```python
from pathlib import Path
from canonic.knowledge import (
    KnowledgeSearch, EntityIndex, load_knowledge_page,
)
from canonic.semantic.loader import list_semantic_sources

root = Path(".")  # from examples/ecommerce/

# Build the entity index from the live semantic sources
sources = list_semantic_sources(root)
entity_index = EntityIndex.from_sources(sources)

# Load the knowledge pages
pages = [load_knowledge_page(p) for p in (root / "knowledge" / "global").glob("*.md")]

engine = KnowledgeSearch(pages)

# Search for a revenue topic — only the policy page matches; the caveat rides along
# automatically because the hit references warehouse_pg.orders.total_revenue
result = engine.search("month-end cutoff", requesting_user="alice")
print([h.page for h in result.hits])
# ['revenue-reporting-policy']
print([(c.page, c.triggered_by) for c in result.caveats])
# [('revenue-excludes-refunds-caveat', ['warehouse_pg.orders.total_revenue'])]

# Search for a units/product topic — definition page matches; the fanout caveat rides along
# because the hit references warehouse_pg.order_items.units_sold
result2 = engine.search("product category", requesting_user="alice")
print([h.page for h in result2.hits])
# ['units-sold-definition']
print([(c.page, c.triggered_by) for c in result2.caveats])
# [('order-items-fanout-caveat', ['warehouse_pg.order_items', 'warehouse_pg.order_items.units_sold'])]
```

### Live rendering

```python
from canonic.knowledge import DefinitionRenderer
from canonic.knowledge.loader import load_knowledge_page

page = load_knowledge_page(root / "knowledge/global/revenue-definition.md")
renderer = DefinitionRenderer(entity_index)

print(renderer.render(page))
# … The live SQL — rendered at read time, never a copy:
# > `sum(amount)`           ← the actual expr from orders.yaml
```

If `orders.yaml` were updated to `expr: "sum(amount * fx_rate)"`, the next render would
reflect `sum(amount * fx_rate)` automatically — no page edit needed.

### Drift detection

`meta.bound_fingerprints` records the measure's fingerprint when the page was authored.
If the `expr` in `orders.yaml` changes, `DriftDetector` flags the page for prose review:

```python
from canonic.knowledge import DriftDetector

detector = DriftDetector()

# Fingerprints match (orders.yaml is unchanged) → no review needed
print(detector.flagged_for_review(page, entity_index))
# []

# After changing orders.yaml to a different expr, the fingerprint diverges:
# → ['warehouse_pg.orders.total_revenue']
# The flag is a review signal, not a silent edit — the prose "why" may now be wrong.
```
