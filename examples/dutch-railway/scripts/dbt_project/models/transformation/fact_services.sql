{{ config(materialized='table') }}

-- Canonic example note: upstream selects the full multi-year services history
-- (~22M rows). To keep this a small, committable demo dataset (matching the
-- "small seed" convention used by examples/ecommerce), we pin to a single
-- service date via the `service_date` dbt var instead of the full history.
